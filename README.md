Mod for Farming Simulator 25
----------------------------
This mod dynamically adjusts the prices of crops, goods, animals, and passive income from placeable generators based on selling habits.

No more endlessly farming one crop or product for maximum profit. Be mindful not to overproduce and sell too much of any resource, or risk impacting the local market and dropping the prices.

Compete with other players in multiplayer games over the supply and demand of resources.

The annual demand of each resource is €35,000 worth on hard, €63,000 on normal, and €105,000 on easy economic difficulty. Doubled if seasonal growth is off.
