Mod for Farming Simulator 25

Adjusts the market prices for each product, crop, or animal type based on a supply-and-demand system.

The market demands an annual supply of each product type. Roughly €75,000 worth on hard. €135,000 on medium, and €225,000 on easy. Doubled if seasonal growth is disabled.

Selling more than the demanded amount will decrease the prices of a product due to the overabundance. Selling less will increase the prices due to the scarcity.

The prices can range between 40% and 120% of normal values.

A minimum 4-hour grace period allows for selling without immediate negative impacts to prices.
